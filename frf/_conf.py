class Conf(dict):
    """FRF configuration manager.

    Imports/executes the python module referenced by ``settings_file`` and then
    puts all the toplevel variables into a dictionary like object.

    Settings are set and retrieved using either dictionary syntax, or property
    syntax.  If you are retrieving a setting using property syntax, and the
    setting does not exist, None will be returned.

    If you had a settings file like this:

    .. code-block:: python
       :caption: yourproject/settings.py

        DEBUG = False

        SQLALCHEMY_CONNECTION_URI = 'sqlite://'

    Then you could use the configuration manager like so:

    >>> from yourproject import conf
    >>> conf.STUFF  # will return None because the setting doesn't exist
    >>> conf.DEBUG
    False
    >>> conf.get('SOME_SETTING')
    >>> conf.SOME_SETTING = True
    >>> conf.get('SOME_SETTING')
    True
    >>> conf.get('OTHER_SETTING')
    >>> conf['OTHER_SETTING'] = 1
    >>> conf.OTHER_SETTING
    1
    >>>
