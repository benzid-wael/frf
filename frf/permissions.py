    Other permissions can inherit from this, and need to override
    ``has_permission``.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python
       :caption: permissions.python

       from frf import permissions

       class StaffRequiredPermission(permissions.BasePermission):
            '''Require staff permissions.'''

                return user it not None and user.is_staff

    def has_permission(self, req, view, **kwargs):
        """Check permission.
